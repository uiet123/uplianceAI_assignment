Hi, The is uplianceAI_assignment
In this assignemt i have created a Counter and UserForm page, in counter page when we click on increment button the count with increase and the height of the color will also increase simultaneously and vice versa with the decrement button and in the UserForm page, i have created a form where user can input the data and when the user will click on submit button, the form data will be visible in the text editor at right side of the page and the user can format the form accordingly.
This whole app is authenticated with the google signin using firebase and for state management i have used the ContextAPI.
I hope you will like this web application, Thank You.
